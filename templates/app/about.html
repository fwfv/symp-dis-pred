      <p>Welcome to my hobby project!</p>

      <p>This project served as my introduction to various technologies, providing me with a valuable learning experience. I had the opportunity to work with Django for web development, integrate external authentication through Google and allauth, utilize a machine learning model stored as a joblib file for disease prediction, and connect to a PostgreSQL database. The process of implementing features like the contact page with SMTP or Google SMTP further enriched my understanding of web application development. Overall, this project has been a significant milestone in my journey, allowing me to gain practical insights into a diverse range of technologies and skills.</p>

      <p>Feel free to explore the features and functionalities. If you have any suggestions, feedback, or just want to connect, I'd love to hear from you!</p>
